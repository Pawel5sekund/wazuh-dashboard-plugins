# ‚ú® **ESLint Workflow for Code Quality Assurance**
#
# ‚ö° **Overview:**
# This GitHub Action runs ESLint on all JavaScript and TypeScript files (`.js`, `.jsx`, `.ts`, `.tsx`)
# that have changed in a pull request. It ensures that code adheres to defined linting standards,
# helping maintain code quality and consistency across the project.
#
# üõ†Ô∏è **Key Features:**
# - üö® Runs ESLint checks only on changed or renamed JS/TS files (ignores deleted files).
# - üöÄ Ensures code consistency before PRs are merged.
#
# üìñ **References:**
# - ESLint: https://eslint.org
